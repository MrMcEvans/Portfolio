          A text adventure game that lets the users create their own branches of
          the story. The game is built with a Handlebars frontend and a Node backend.
        </p>
        <p>
        The database is built with MariaDB and Sequelize. The game is hosted on Heroku.
        </p>
        <p>
        The team in total consists of 5 developers. This is a passion project
          for all of us. I worked on the backend and database and handled the initial story.
        </p>
        <p>
        When a player creates their own branch it is hosted live with MariaDb to allow
          other players to play their story. With it being hosted on Heroku, the game has a bad
          word filter to prevent any inappropriate content from being posted.
